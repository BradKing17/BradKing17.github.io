						<h3 class="major">Who am I?</h3>
						<p>
							Hey I'm Brad, I'm a recent graduate of Games Technology at the University of the West of England. I've spent the last 8 years developing
							games in my spare time and as part of my degree, most of this time I've worked on learning the software and practices that used in small game dev projects.
							While I've mainly focused on the programming elements of the game dev process, I've also spent time doing 3D modelling, level design and art for the
							various game jams and uni work I've completed. I've had experience with various game engines, Unity and Unreal being my most used, as well as 3D modelling
							software such as Blender and Maya. I've had experience with C++, C#, Javascript and C as part of my studies and personal work.
						</p>

						<h3 class="major">A bit of background.</h3>
						<p>
							I first got a taste of developing video games after first playing the original Little Big Planet and it's level editor,
							I spent time learning how to create emitters and complex shapes using the tools provided by the designers. My first level was a small bomb survival level,
							this was once a very popular type of level in LBP, where players would survive as long as possible from bombs raining from the sky. This ignited an interest
							in how games are made and the industry as a whole.
						</p>

						<p>
							I started learning Unity soon after I got my first PC in 2013 where I had big ambitions, I very quickly learned how difficult game dev can be. However
							I slowly got to grips with the engine and from there start experimenting with small projects that I wanted to work on, learning how to use Blender for models
							and how to import them into Unity.
						</p>
